# Exercise 02 - Use the Fiori Tools to create a Fiori app

In this exercise, you'll create a Fiori Elements web app based on the OData endpoint, which is accessed via the Destination you created earlier. You'll customize the List Report page and add a new Object page with annotations to get a glimpse of the Fiori Tools' full power.

Avoid to copy and paste the snippets and **make use of the autocomplete feature** of the SAP Business Application Studio instead.
