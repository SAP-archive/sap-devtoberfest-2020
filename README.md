## Description

**Devtoberfest 2020 from SAP – An open celebration of what makes us developers – Coding and Collaboration!**

This is an eight week celebration by developers, for developers to kick off the SAP TechEd 2020 season.

* The event will launch with 8 weeks of technical enablement/educational online sessions open to the entire community to highlight key technologies and techniques and plant seed ideas
  * [Topics](./topics/) will include: Kyma, Cloud Application Programming Model, SAP HANA Advanced Analytics, Fiori, ABAP, SAP Business Technology Platform APIs, Workflow, Building VSCode Extensions, Running Community Open Source Projects
* Then event will culminate in a one week, build sprint
* The Challenge:
  * Come up with your own developer problem – for the pure love of being a developer. Build something that makes your fellow SAP developers lives better and do so in open source so everyone can share in it. All projects during the build sprint will be given back to the SAP developer community. What you decide to build could be a tool, a library, or even just a code sample. Or an enhancement to an existing community project
  * The real “prize” here is for the whole developer community which will benefit from what is built or started during this event
* GitHub is the open platform for this entire event! Code, collaboration, planning, submission, support from SAP, etc - - all via GitHub
  * Even our planning and communication will be done primarily via GitHub: <https://github.com/sap-samples/sap-devtoberfest-2020>
* The whole SAP developer community will be encouraged to participate.  Like any open source project teams are encouraged to do as much as possible in the open and even accept issues and pull requests from non-team members during the build week
* Throughout the week of the main build sprint we will also do live streams to interview and expose the community to the teams competing. So this is also a great opportunity to get more exposure for your community project
* The output will be code published to a public, git-based repository and a maximum 6 minute video demo of the project (ideally linked from the readme of your project)
* During TechEd 2020, voting will be open for the community to select the winner

## Judging

* **How relevant/helpful is your solution to other SAP developers**
* No commercial license - [Suggested Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical)

* How much of its was actually built during the event and how much was reuse. Existing projects are allowed, but judging will focus on commits done during the Contest Period.
* Technological fascination.  Innovative use of technology.  Use of multiple types of technology.  Use of popular trending technology.
* Entertainment value.  Does the presentation grab your attention?  Does it stand out compared to others?  Does it tell a story that is memorable?
* Only pull requests/commits from users who have met the individual eligibility requirements in will be considered.
